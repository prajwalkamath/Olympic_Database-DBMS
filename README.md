# Olympic_Database-DBMS
We want to design and implement a database for storing the information of all
competitors and their participation in the Olympic Games held over the past years.

A competitor has an competitor ID, name, gender, country, birth date and can have
coach.

Each Olympiad has the year, a season (summer or winter), the country where it took
place, and the city.

Every competitor in the database participates in at least one Olympiad. A competitor
can participate in several events in one Olympiad and can, in fact, participate in more
than one Olympiad.

An event has an event name, location, and scheduled time and date, which athletes
were scheduled to compete in which events and how they placed, and who the
winner(s) of the event was (e.g., what kind of medal they were awarded). Null values
are used for winners and placings until the event has been held.

Events in the Olympics may be either individual or team events. If it is a team event, we
wish to know who the members of each team were.

The project is divided into four phases.
